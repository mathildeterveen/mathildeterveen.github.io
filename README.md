#### BEHAVIORAL DATA SCIENTIST WITH A LOVE FOR PEOPLE, PROJECTS, AND AI MODELS

How can artificial intelligence models, like ChatGPT, help you in your life, job, and organization to make it better? Where do humans do a better job and where do AI models fail? These questions have been the focus of my research in the last years, and I can help you in answering them for you or your organization. But I also realize that much of it is still unknown, and further research is needed on this topic, which I am eager to contribute to. 

Apart from my research experience, I also bring with me 15 years of expertise in various project and change management roles in data-intensive organizations, particularly in the healthcare, energy, and ICT sectors. This gives me a unique blend of technical skills, research abilities, and organizational problem-solving capabilities.
