### I LOVE PEOPLE <ins>AND</ins> DATA

Currently, I am studying full time to improve my skills in data science and writing a masterthesis about the way NLP models make use of analogies. I love to broaden my knowledge further in the area of NLP, especially within healthcare. 

In the past 14 years, I helped to find solutions in projects, where others did not see them anymore. I did this by identifying the problems using data and seeing the possibilities in you, your employees and colleagues. I have a background in different project and changemanagement roles within data-intensive organizations, especially in the health, energy and ICT.
